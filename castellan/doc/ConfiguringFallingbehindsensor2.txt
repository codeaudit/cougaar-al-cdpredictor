After 'Send GLS root' button is clicked, PSUFBSensor2Plugin releases the 'LoadIndicator' with normal as an initial value and 'StartIndicator'. 
The 'LoadIndicator'will be sent to the manager of community to which the current agent belongs. 
The 'LoadIndicator' will be changed as the falling behindness changes.
The 'StartIndicator'will be sent to 'TRANSCOM'agent where the loadforecaster plugin is running.
We can see 'LoadIndicator' and 'StartIndicator'both through servlet.

IMPORTANT: Insure that the system time between all the systems being run is synchronized.
